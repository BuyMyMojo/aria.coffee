I'll be expanding this as I work on it but for now this is my first more indepth website

## The What

Well that's simple to explain; It's a website and you're browing it now lol.

## The Why

Recently I joined a community for some very **üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è**(mostly, there are many people of different identities there!) and it's full of many very techinical people. It's a cosy little community and I feel genuinely welcome there.

We where discussing domain names and this one wasn't owned! I'm addicted to coffee so it seemed like the perfect fit for me~

After purchasing I needed to decide what I wanted to do with it, for a little over a day (Until not long before I started to write this) it just redirected to my [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bzrn33tcfgjxnsanvg6py3xn) account.

I eventually got inspired by both [Alyxia](https://alyxia.dev/) and [Alex's](https://buh.moe/) websites. Finally convinced to make something from scratch I made the website you're looking at now!

This has been my first time working mostly from scratch to make my personal website, more on that described bellow!

## The How

This website was made using [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the build system and I decided to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) instead of basing my own css off Alex's after she convinced me.

![A discord screenshot containing the following messages: Sent by @BuyMyMojo: "getting my brain around css and styling hurts, I'm man handling some of your css @amemoia", Sent by @amemoia: "DONT LOOK AT MY CSS ITS SO BAD", "EVERYTHING HAS ITS OWN CLASS", "USE A FRAMEWORK"](/static/img/blog/UseAFramework_20241217_002719.png)

While I got started early on following the basic [blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) but took a break to make my very first 88x31px button!

![88x31 pixel button with the text 'Aria' and the top half of a human human face on the right hand side](https://web.archive.org/web/20241216133507if_/https://dev.aria.coffee/static/img/buttons/aria.gif)
<sub>This is a version of the image hosted on archive.org so the blog doesn't change</sub>

I made it pretty quickly in Krita using the lovely picute of me which was drawn by Auryn!

88x31 buttons have a history that I wont get into here, you can read more [here](https://tekeye.uk/computer_history/powered-by) and if you'd like to see thhe buttons of my friends then go to the [friends page](/friends)
<sub>If you wanna exchange buttons shoot me a message on <a href="https://discord.com/users/383507911160233985" target="_blank">discord!</a></sub>

## Final thoughts

I am very greatful for these goobers who have inspured, ecouraged and debugged with me on this website, there is still a lot for me to learn about web development and more to discover about myself honestly.

I plan to make this website an outlet for a lot of my learning ~~along with my already mentioned BlueSky~~ and I hope you'll stick around.

### What's next?

Not sure, I kinda wanna figure out how to add emotes like discord into these blogs because I'm an internet degenerate who feels the ned to put emoted in every message I send, after that I might try to style the website a bit more but I think it's in an *alright* place for now lol
