<h2 class="text-2xl"><strong>## What is this?</strong></h2>

<br />

A couple months ago I made the post <a href="https://aria.coffee/posts/post-2/" target="_blank">Pre-HRT musing</a> which was some details and thoughts of my journey towards getting <abbr title="Hormone Replacement Therapy">HRT</abbr>, since then things have gone VERY WELL so here I am with an update.

<br />


<h2 class="text-2xl"><strong>## Where are we now?</strong></h2>

<br />

I am now 118 days into HRT at the time of writing, it has been honestly insane. from the softening of skin, to noticable change in body shape!

<br />

None of this will come as a surprise to people who have been on HRT for a few years of course but it is always going to come as a shock to people going through this at first, it's a big shift after all.

<br />

<h2 class="text-2xl"><strong>## What I took</strong></h2>

<br />

I started with Estradiol Valerate tablets and Bicalutamide on DIY. I decided on taking 3x 2mg <abbr title="Estrogen">E</abbr> tablets spread across my day with a 50mg Bica tablet in the morning.

<br />

After about 3 weeks I took what was my second blood test (first on HRT) at the request of my <abbr title="I HIGHLY recomend them if you're in Australia btw">[Telehealth Gender Clinic](https://www.ttgc.com.au)</abbr> GP, things where looking pretty solid! 332pmol/L of Oestradiol and my <abbr title="Testosterone">T</abbr> was down to 3.6 pmol/L (Which was just from the E since Bica doesn't actually stop T production!).

<br />

For the next few months the changes where obviously gradual but they where there and slowly but surely life returned to my soul.

<br />

Just a couple weeks ago I got accepted into my new job and I needed to take a picture of myself for my ID card so I took one and shared it with the girlies. The following response I got sits in my head rent free almost every day giving me good vibes.

<br />

<blockquote style="background-color: #C2EBC0; color: rgb(10 10 10);" class="p-2">"You look like that after three months??? Not even slightly fair" - V</blockquote>

<br />

Basically things HRT wise have been great. I have felt my mood improve and my self image get better too. girl starts to be more girl and is happy about that, crazy!

<br />

I now take [4mg of Estradiol Valorate via injection every 5 days](https://estrannai.se/#i0_cu,4,5,1-4,5,1-4,5,1-4,5,1-4,5,1-4,5,1_c,4,5,1) thanks to my perscription! Only needing to deal with administering my E once every 5 days is a life style game changer, having 100 syringes and 200 needles in my room makes me look insane but at least I'm not popping pills like clock work any more~

<br />

Most recently I came out to family too, I used getting my perscription as an excuse to finally tell them. Overall it went well, Parents where *fine* with it <sub>(but I haven't heard a she/her or an Aria from them yet ;;;)</sub> and my sisters where honestly super cool and supportive. My oldest sister, T, was actually really invested asking about where my name came from and having some questions about it all. I feel super lucky for how things turned out for me.

<br />

<h2 class="text-2xl"><strong>## What's next?</strong></h2>

<br />

Now that I've moved to injections and got my perscription I need to get another blood test in 3 months to check how things are going with my levels and then have a follow up appointment with the GP.

<br />

Since I'm out to both family and my place of work I actually feel comfortable getting clothing and items I'm comfortable in, when I get my first full paycheck from work I am going clothes shopping 100%.

<br />

<sub> I also need to order more <abbr title="Progesterone">Prog</abbr>,,,</sub>

<br />
<br />

I have also been voice training! My commute to work is an hour drive so I try to get some [Pitch Naturalisation](https://wiki.sumianvoice.com/wiki/pages/PIPM/) practice in on the way there and back, I do however plan on also following the [Selfcest Voice Training](https://whtwnd.com/isuggest.selfce.st/3luwj44eyei2n) method, I'm not sure who my target voice references will be besides maybe Ellie from the last of us and motoko from Ghost in the Shell lmao.

<br />

this was extremely unorganised and jank but I am glad to get this out of my mind, there is more I want to write and share eventually but I still gotta sort that out in my head,,, you'll probably find it all on [my bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:valun42etpm73we7bgyh64ge) anyway!!
