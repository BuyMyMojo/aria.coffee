## Why backup?

This probably doesn't need an explanation for anyone reading this but backups are important!

When you're online accounts rely on just a few files or physical devices for access making sure you have securely stored backups is essential to not loose access to those accounts.

## What did I need to backup?

I'll expand on some more of the security stuff I have setup from the last post here too.

- SSH key(s)
- PGP Key(s)
- 2FA codes
- Security Keys ([Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/au/product/yubikey-5-series/yubikey-5-nfc/))
- 1password Emergency Kit
- Account 2FA backups codes (For example discord provides codes to recover your account if you cannot access your codes)
- Exodus wallet backup keys
